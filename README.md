Title: Excellent book
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2021
Review: This is the first review I ever wrote, but I had to say how much this book healed me. I had to put my 15 year old dog down and started having panic attacks soon after. I never had a panic attack in my life and it scared me. I knew it must have been something to do with loosing her so I purchased this book. I can't tell you how much this book made me understand my feelings. I did all of the grief work it suggested and by the middle of the book I had no more panic attacks or anxiety!!! Thank you so much to the author of this book. This helped me to put my life back together.

Title: Practical toolkit with actual strategies to cope
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2021
Review: After my dad passed away from COVID, I was struggling. I still am, but I am doing better. What I found is that psychotherapy [sessions with a psychotherapist] rarely takes you far just by itself, you need to do your own work in your own time. And you need guidance for that. If you are a kind of person that likes to be proactive about their own healing, and feels better by just doing something, (anything really) to try to cope - this book will be perfect for you. It is hard to go through a loss on your own, with this book you have a feeling like you are not...

Title: Extremely helpful
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2019
Review: I found this book helpful, kind, sincere, and smart. I read it 6 months after the death of my father. It helped with many feelings I was having around his death, and it really helped with the unexpected anxiety I was feeling. I found it helpful, as well, in forging a new way forward with my mother, who lost her best friend and partner of 61 years. I also found the booked helped me deal with some very old grief around some childhood issues with my dad. The author speaks from both years of experience working as a grief therapist and from her own personal experiences of loss. I've bought copies of the book for several relatives and friends, including my mother (who is also finding it very helpful).

Title: A valuable and necessary addition to grief literature
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2018
Review: Claire Bidwell Smith tackles grief and loss in Anxiety: The Missing Stage of Grief the way she has in her two previous books (The Rules of Inheritance and After This: When Life is Over, Where Do We Go)--directly and gently, honestly and warmly, realistically and optimistically. Reading this book is like overhearing a conversation between a beautiful and gifted writer and the most incisive therapist. Bidwell Smith is comfortable as both, and shines in her latest book. Included with her own experiences are tools for assessment and the exercises she offers to patients dealing with grief and anxiety in her private practice. She has astutely identified the role that anxiety plays in loss and grief, and has written this wonderful book as a service to all who are suffering. Five enthusiastic stars.

Title: Have a Loss and Starting to Have Anxiety? BUY THIS
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2019
Review: I ordered this for myself after my mom passed away unexpectedly and I was starting to experience physical symptoms of anxiety that I could not control. Despite knowing exactly what it was, I was unable to handle it. This book definitely helps get through that period in life that you never thought you'd have to manage. If you're having uncontrolled symptoms that weren't there before, this book may be helpful for you to start managing yourself in a healthy way.

Title: Extremely helpful book for those dealing with loss
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2018
Review: I love this book so much I already bought a second copy for a friend. I lost an aunt who was like a second mother to me in April and felt like I was struggling through the grief process. I love that not only did this make me feel like everything I was going through was not only normal, but also gave me exercises to help me work through my grief in a healthy way. I'm now a bit more than six months out from the loss and I feel like it's helped me to find the gift in all of this and become more resilient. This is a really helpful book that I now recommend to anyone who's struggling through a loss.

Title: Very helpful book
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2022
Review: My beloved mother died and I was overwhelmed by grief and anxiety. As the pain of grief subsided the anxiety did not. This book is full of helpful steps to understand anxiety and keep moving forward. Very well written. It has been very helpful.

Title: The Title is Better Than the Book
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2021
Review: I was thrilled to discover this book, but it was a long slog reading it, without much to take away (besides the title). I was looking for something on anxiety during the pandemic, and I knew it was related to grief, so I had high hopes. I could have written it better myself.
